# ==========================================
seed: 42
mode: "multi_stage"               # Options: "single_stage" or "multi_stage"
constitutive_eq: "maxwell_B"      # Focused on Maxwell-B for now

# --- Missing Keys (Required for Script to Run) ---

# --- Sampling Parameters ---
n_samples: 10000                 # Number of valid samples to collect per stage
rate_min: 0                      # Min deformation rate (log-uniform sampling)
rate_max: 2.0                    # Max deformation rate (log-uniform sampling)

# --- Physics Parameters ---
