# Maxwell-B PINN Configuration
# ==================================

# --- Global Settings ---
seed: 42
# Root directory where flow_type subfolders exist (e.g., flow_data/uniaxial_extension)
output_dir: "flow_data"
# The flow data to train on. Can be a single string or a list of flow types.
# The main script will iterate over this if it is a list.
flow_type: "uniaxial_extension"
model_type: "maxwell_B"

# --- Rheological Parameters (Used in Maxwell-B Residual) ---
rheology:
  eta0: 1.0        # Zero-shear-rate viscosity (η₀)
  lam: 0.5         # Relaxation time (λ in the constitutive equation)

# --- Model Architecture (Multi-Layer Perceptron) ---
model:
  # Layer structure: [Input dim, Hidden 1, Hidden 2, ..., Output dim]
  # Input (L) is 9 (3x3 flat), Output (T) is 6 (symmetric flat).
  layers: [9, 128, 128, 128, 6]
  activation: "tanh"           # Activation function: "tanh", "relu", "sine" or "sigmoid"
  dropout: 0.0                  # Dropout rate (0.0 means no dropout)

# --- Training Parameters ---
training:
  num_epochs: 500
  batch_size: 64
  learning_rate: 5e-5   #0.0001
  weight_decay: 0.0001
  # The TARGET weight for the physics loss (λ_phys).
  # The script will RAMP this weight linearly from 0 up to this value
  # over the course of training for stability.
  lambda_phys: 0
